        Patrizia has perfected her style philosophy over the last thirty years to three fundamental steps:<br>
        — Be the true you<br>
        — Wear it<br>
        — “Deliver Your Style” to the world

        <p class="mb-4">Born in Torino, Italy, Patrizia's passion for fashion began at age 11 in her family’s clothing business. Over the years, her love for styling grew into a profession — shaped by hands-on experience, international exposure, and an innate gift for seeing beauty in every person.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The *Deliver Your Style* concept took form in London in 2008, when she immersed herself in British fashion while honoring her Italian roots. Her approach was deeply inspired by her father's commitment to customer care and personalized service.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 italic">“My father taught me to read people with care — to understand not just their size, but their story. That’s still my guiding light today.”</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center">A Career Rooted in Global Influence</h2>
      <p>Patrizia refined her styling craft through personal shopping at Harrods in London, and later in New York City through collaborations with Modabox and designer Tiziano Zorzan. She’s managed fashion shows, dressed runways, and guided private clients with her intuitive approach to fashion psychology.</p>
      <p>Her clients describe her as part stylist, part soul whisperer. She believes that every outfit is an emotional memory, a story in fabric — and her closet is a gallery of moments from a life well-styled.</p>

          <p><strong>Italian Roots:</strong> “In Italy, beauty is woven into everyday life — from morning coffee strolls to the open-air markets.”</p>

    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">A Philosophy that Dresses the Soul</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Patrizia encourages clients to align their wardrobe with their energy — to embrace personal style as a form of self-expression, self-care, and even healing. Her approach, “Dress Your Soul,” invites people to listen inward and choose clothing that reflects how they feel and who they are.</p>
      <p>She's now building new collaborations with creatives and clients who want to style their future with intention.</p>
